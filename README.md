## Introduction and Overview the Project
--
Effective data management is critical for any company, especially in industries like logistics, where operational efficiency and customer satisfaction are key drivers of success. A well-designed database system enables businesses to store, retrieve, and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations and informed decision-making.

This project leverages SQL Server to create a scalable and efficient database for a logistics company. The system is designed to handle key operations such as order management, shipment tracking, and payment processing. With a focus on normalization and efficient querying, this database supports real-time operations and reporting.
